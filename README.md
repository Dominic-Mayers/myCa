# myCa

For convenience, this repository reproduces the directory structure described in these
[excellent instructions](https://openssl-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest) to create a certificate authority (CA) to use locally in your machine. A local CA is useful when you test web applications in your machine, because browsers such as Chrome do not accept self-signed certificates. It also contains straigtforward scripts that simply executes the few openssl commands described in these instructions. It does not replace these instructions, because there is a need to adapt the configuration files to your particular case. However, the proposed configuration requires very little changes when one needs only to create and sign a  certificate for a web server.
